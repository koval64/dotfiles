# dotfiles


### Automagically backup dotfiles.

update.sh

all dotfiles added in bash script `update.sh` to variable `config_files` are automagically copied to directory `homedir` unless... you change it

usage:

```markdown
$ bash update.sh
```

and now you can upload your carefully choosen config files to github

they are safe now
